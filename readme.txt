A simple plug-in that you can code to activate/deactivate when detecting mobile devices. It can possibly interfere with non-mobile procedures. 

== Description ==

This plug-in is designed to be activated/deactivated through coding, it requires that jQuery be in place before hand, and checks to make sure this is so. It takes one argument, a variable, which can easily be edited. This variable allows you to choose which version you want loaded. It will get the jQuery minified library and the core jQuery mobile css files from the google apis repository. It registers the script via wp_register_script, and then enqueues the script via wp_enqueue_script. It will then load the style via wp_enqueue_style. My thinking was to activate/deactivate this plugin upon determining if or not a mobile device is requesting data, in conjunction with switching templates (via coding). IE: if mobile, switch to mobile template and activate plug-in, if not, load default template and ensure plug-in is deactivated.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `jQuery_mobile_js_css_google_api_loader.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. only Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, if you are using a mobile template ( you are sure that mobile devices are your target )
3. Please use only if you intend to check for mobile devices, there has been reported issues of interference of normal operations when using jQuery mobile.
